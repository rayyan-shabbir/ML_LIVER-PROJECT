I am working on a machine learning project : Predective Model on the efficacy of Medications on different liver related labs result. I have already preprocess and make ready my whole data.
I also already trained my random forest model for this.

Now I wanted you to help em with my class diagram, As I am also using flask app to make predictions in my website.
I will explain you workflow and entities of my project then help me with class diagram using all OOP Principles like : Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritence, Composition, Aggregation.

Workflow::
user get start/index page, he will then click to login button, simply login page appears he then enter credentials and a "User" Database exists which authenticate user. When suer is authenticated then home page appear then go to any of 5 labs page like ALT, AST, GGT, HCV, Bilirubin. And there will be form asking for PatientID and Practice, and then make prediction button is clicked and there a page shows all other information related to that user + the prediction of our model.

The entities I have in my mind to show in class diagram are ::
FlaskApp
UserDB
DB Manager
PreprocessLabs
Model

Diagram I have in my mind till yet::


Flask App *-------- Model                              
      *
       |----------- UserDB @ -------- DB Manager ------* Preprocess_labs
                                                                                                           |
                                                                                                           |
                                                                                         _________|________ 
                                                                                         |.      |       |.       |.     |   
                                                                                         A     B     C       D     E

* means composition
@ means aggregation
A : ALT LAB
B : AST LAB
C : GGT LAB
D : HCV LAB
E : Bilirubin Lab       


Functionality of each entitty (not restreict to that can also add further if you want to)
FlaskApp : routes (index, login, signup, home, lab predictor)
UserDB : DB_Manager instance to make connection with db, authenticate user from db using query.
DBManager : Connection with mongodb, Load dbs.
Model : Load csvs, train model and save model, load model (so instance will be sued in FlaskApp), predict result.
Preprocess_Labs : Having mongodb aggregate queries which uses db manager to load db and using aggregate query to load data from db and save as jsons.

Furthermore I have also a EDA class which load json and perform eda feature engineerig on it, the that csv are use by my model to train model. But i not add in my class diagram bcz maybe it not fit in it according to my sense.

Show me diagrams also having all private and public data members or dta variables.                  



I know that this class Diagram is not perfect so that's why it is your task to help me with the perfect class diagrams follow all oop principles.


 (You can help me with any other possibility or any other suggestion yoiu can give to make my class diagram the best one)
